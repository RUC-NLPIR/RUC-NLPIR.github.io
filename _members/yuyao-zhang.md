I am a Ph.D student from Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China. Now I am supervised by Professor Zhicheng Dou, researching on generative retrieval, recommendation, and complex query decomposition. I am also very interested in the implementation and application of Artificial Intelligence, learning the technical stack and knowledge related to development engineering projects. My vision is to develop user-friendly AI products.
